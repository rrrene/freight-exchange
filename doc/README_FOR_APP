= Rails Application Documentation

Build this documentation with either rake doc:* for standard rails doc output, or with the rake doc:ajax task to get nicer doc layout using breakpointer's ajax-rdoc (which is available at http://github.com/breakpointer/ajax-rdoc and has to installed separately).

== Installation

The first step is to run these rake tasks: 

  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed

Now the database is fully migrated and seeded. Start the webserver with

  rails server

A setup screen will be ready at http://localhost:3000
