# The Admin::AppConfigsController provides functionality for managing all 
# system-wide settings in the app, e.g. main language or demo-mode, via the 
# backend.
#
# Like in all Admin controllers, basic functions new, create, edit, update, 
# delete and index are provided via inheritance from Admin::BaseController.
