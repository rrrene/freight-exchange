= Simple Search

Sometimes you want search capabilities for your little rails app, but using 
something Solr, Ferret, Hyper Estraier etc. would be total overkill. 
Introducing SimpleSearch, primitive searching for the rest of us.

== What this is

An easy-to-use, fast, simple search implementation with nearly no bells 
and whistles for simple projects, e.g. internal wikis, intranet solutions and 
the like.

== What this is not

A full fledged search solution for the next "1 billion pageviews"-monster-site.

== Installation & Setup

=== Migration

The needed migration:

  class CreateSimpleSearches < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :simple_searches do |t|
        t.string  :item_type
        t.integer :item_id
        t.text    :text
        t.timestamps
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :simple_searches
    end
  end

=== Setting up
  
==== Adding models to the index

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    simple_search
  end

Omit the attributes option and all attributes are automatically indexed, but
sometimes you might not want that (especially in case of users):

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    simple_search :attributes => %w(email login)
  end

==== Simple searching:

  SimpleSearch.search "some query"
  SimpleSearch / "some other query"

Of course, the index is updated automatically.

==== To manually update the search index:
  
  SimpleSearch << User.first  # update the index for a specific user
  SimpleSearch << User        # update the index of all users
