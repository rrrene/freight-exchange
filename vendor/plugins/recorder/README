= Welcome 

*Recorder* is a rails plugin designed to provide a way to track the changes 
made to your models.

== How to use it

=== Tracking profile changes

This example assumes you already have a User model in your application.

Create a model Recording and add the following required fields:

  t.string    :item_type, :limit => 30
  t.integer   :item_id
  t.string    :action, :limit => 10 #create, update, destroy
  t.text      :diff

The model has to inherit from the Recorder::Recording class:

  class Recording < Recorder::Recording
  end

Now create an observer called UserObserver. It has to inherit from the 
Recorder::Observer class:

  class UserObserver < Recorder::Observer
  end
  
Finally, add the observer to your application configuration:

  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer

That's it! Enjoy.

=== What's next?

You can add your own bells and whistels via inheritance. Just take a look at 
the Recorder::Observer class.
