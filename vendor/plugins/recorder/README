= Recorder

The recorder plugin provides a way to track changes to your models.


== Example for tracking profile changes

This example assumes you already have a User model in your application.

Create a model UserRecords and add the following required fields:

  t.string    :item_type, :limit => 30
  t.integer   :item_id
  t.string    :action, :limit => 10 #create, update, destroy
  t.text      :diff

The UserRecord model has to inherit from the Recording class:

  class UserRecord < Recorder::Recording
  end

Now create an observer called UserObserver and provide the following code:

  class UserObserver < Recorder::Observer
    ignore :updated_at, :created_at, :password, :password_confirmation
    recording_class 'UserRecord'
  end
  
Finally, add the observer to your application configuration:

  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer

That's it.
